# Presentation at the EDDI 2021 Conference

## General information

The [13th Annual European Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) User Conference (EDDI21)](https://eddi21.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/1) will be held virtually on Tuesday, November 30 and Wednesday, December 1, 2021. It is proposed to apply for a Short Presentation (10 minutes long, plus 5 minutes for questions) on behalf of the INTERSTAT project.


## Presentation outline

The general structure of the presentation can be the same as for the the [SDMX Global Conference](sdmx-gc.md), but more insistence must be put on the DDI-CDI model instead of the SDMX model. Also, EDDI is two months after the SDMX GC, so hopefully there will be more results to report.

We should aim at a duration of 10 minutes, so about 8 slides. The presentation outline could be:

- The INTERSTAT project (1 slide)
- The CEF and the Context Broker (2 slides)
- The NGSI-LD Information Model (1 slide)
- Problem statement (1 slide)
- First results (2 slides)
- Future work (1 slide)


## Submission

##### Title: Dissemination of contextualized statistical information: achieving interoperability between DDI-CDI and NGSI-LD

##### Presenters: Franck Cotton (Insee), Arofan Gregory (CODATA/DDI Alliance)

INTERSTAT, a project funded under the European Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) initiative [1], aims at developing an open framework allowing the interoperability between national statistical portals and the European Data portal in order to build cross-border data services.

One way to reach this interoperability is to allow statistical open data to be made available through a key building block of the CEF infrastructure known as the Context Broker [2]. This would allow to disseminate statistical data in a way that can be contextualized in time and space, interoperable with other sources, and available via simple and standard web services for consumption on various platforms.

The core specification for the Context Broker is NGSI-LD [3], an ETSI [4] standard for context information (IoT, Smart Cities, etc.) which combines an information model and an API. To disseminate statistical information through the Context Broker, it is necessary to map statistical information models to NGSI-LD, in particular the DDI Cross-domain integration model and other foundational information models used in the statistical community.

INTERSAT is working at building this cross-standard data model and a software implementation of this bridge capability. The project includes three concrete pilots that will allow to experiment and validate the results of this activity.
