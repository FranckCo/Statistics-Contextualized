# Editing diagrams

It is recommended to use [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the diagrams documenting the pilots, in particular the models, data pipelines, etc. 

Diagrams.net (previously draw.io) stores the diagrams as text files and is integrated with GitHub, so the diagrams can be versioned and attributed to their authors.

To create a new diagram:

* Browse to https://app.diagrams.net/ and select "GitHub" in the "Save diagrams to:" dialog box
* Select "Create new diagram"
* Give the name and type of the diagram
* A dialog box is displayed with the message: "Authorization required/Authorize this app in GitHub:"
* Click on "Authorize"
* Enter your GitHub user id and password if you are prompted (ie. if you are not already connected to GitHub)
* In the list of repositories you have access to, select INTERSTAT/Statistics-Contextualized, then the `img/`folder
* Enter a commit message describing the diagram you are adding
* Start drawing

The procedure is similar for the modification of existing diagrams.
