* Istat SEP:
  * Ontology update for semantic operability with standard metamodels (started but not concluded)
  * Data and metadata loaded on mySQL
  * Harmonization done via SQL query. SQL code to be shared.
  * Mapping done via Monolith. 
  * Query / Integration done via SparQL query. Code to be shared
  * Query output in rdf format 

* Istat S4Y:
  * Ontology to be completed and revised with Insee
  * Data and metadata loaded on mySQL
  * Harmonization student attendance to be finished, school facilities done.
  * Mapping student attendance to be finished, school facilities done.
  * Query / Integration to be produced
  * RDF output to be produced

* Insee: GF
  * Ontology final
  * Data published on FTP and GraphDB
  * Metadata: CSVW and DCAT

#### Work on client applications

* Suggested priorities: GF, SEP
