# Test case

A concrete example is needed in order to test the work on the interoperability of NGSI-LD and statistical models.

The pilot projects defined in Activity 3 of the Interstat project are good candidates, as they provide at the same time (open) datasets of different kinds and use cases for these data. Other data can be used for testing specific aspects.

## Interstat pilots

### The School For You (S4Y)

One of the main objectives of this use case is to respond to the need of citizens and political decision-makers to know the distribution of students or potential students in the territory and the services addressed to them, especially the distribution of schools by field and for structural characteristics. Parents who must choose the school for their children need to know not only the location, but also the educational services that the school offers and the results that the students may achieve in that school. It is also interesting for a student, who must choose the address of university studies, to know the career opportunities and demands of the job market in a particular area. Finally, the comparison on the dynamics of foreign work or training orientations for example in neighbouringFrance could provide useful information for the choice.

### Geolocalized Facilities (GF)

The main objective of this pilot is to disseminate information about facilities or equipments so that it can be contextualized in space and integrated with other sources of data.

Two specific user stories are defined for the GF pilot:

* In the “visitor” case, we consider a user visiting a place she does not know and wondering where the nearest facilities of different types are located. She also would like to know what events are programmed  in  the  nearby  stadiums,  theatres  of  cultural  venues.  From  the  description  of locations or events, it should be simple to navigate on the web for further detail (e.g. on artists or sport teams, history of places, links to the locations’ web sites, etc.).

* The “local decider” story is about a person in charge of an investment decision at a local level. It can be the manager of a bus company wondering if he should replace an old vehicle, an employee of an educational public service assessing the creation of a new class in a community school, or a young couple thinking of moving to a rural place, etc. He needs information about the level and capacity of the equipment in the neighbourhood, linked with data on the demographic evolution at a fine level. He will probably need to combine that information with other sources more specifically relevant to his specific problem.

### Support for Environment Policies (SEP)

One of the main goals of this use case is to enrich air quality information, produced to support local public authorities responsible for environmental policies. More in detail, several decision makers could get insights from the combination of:

* sensor data, measuring the concentration of air pollutants;
* statistical data, describing the structure and the main characteristics of the resident population.

Linking air quality indicators and demographic data could allow decision makers to prioritize target areas of intervention. As an example of data integration benefits, a set of focused actions could be planned according to:

* the resident population living in areas where air pollutants exceed air quality thresholds;
* the assessment of the effectsof air pollution on vulnerable population groups.

## Other data

The SEP pilot involves sensor data, a specific kind of data for which interoperability with statistitical data might be interesting. If SEP is not chosen for the main test case, a specific study of the interoperability of NGSI-LD and the [Semantic Sensor Network Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) remains useful.
