# Statistics Contextualized

One objective of the [Interstat](https://cef-interstat.eu/) project is to facilitate the dissemination of statistical data via the [CEF Context Broker](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Context+Broker).

[NGSI-LD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGSI-LD) is the information model and API specification for the Context Broker, so the interoperability between NGSI-LD and statistical information models like [DDI-CDI](https://ddialliance.org/announcement/public-review-ddi-cross-domain-integration-ddi-cdi) should be studied.
