# Pilot services impact assessment: methodology and KPIs

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Scope and objectives of the document

**Task 3.3 – Impact assessment**

This task will define the methodology to assess the impact of the piloted innovative services
and the benefits for the different stakeholders involved. The methodology will define
processes and KPIs to measure the service impact from different point of views including, for
instance, socio-economic benefits for citizens and business, and technical achievements in
terms of open data provisioning, reuse and interoperability. Based on this methodology the
task will perform the assessment of the impact of the outcomes of the Action, collecting and
analysing the measurements related to the KPIs identified for each validation dimension.
The activity will have the following output(s):

- Report containing a detailed description of the use cases to demonstrate the cross-border
  benefits of the proposed solution.
- Pilot services deployed and working in real environments.
- Pilot technical report.
- Impact assessment methodology and report.

#### 1.1.1 Overview of the Interstat framework

- Support for Environmental Policies (SEP): One of the main goals of this use case is to enrich air quality data with demographic analysis, to support local public authorities responsible for environmental policies.
- Geolocalized facilities (GF): dissemination of information about facilities and integration with related sources
- School for You (S4Y): This pilot allows users, such as citizens and political decision-makers, to discover aggregated data resulting from the integration of several sources about school attendance and the distribution of students in Italy and France.

### 1.2 Assessment framework

#### 1.2.1 Methodology for the impact assessment

Definition of three main areas for impact assessment
Back-end (tools shareability, service reuse, reproducibility….)
Front-end (user friendly interface, metadata, relevance of the selected topics)
Compliance with MQA

#### 1.2.2 KPIs for the impact assessment

#### 1.2.3 Stakeholders involvement
